"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",1,Developer,"I've been coding in Python for 6 years and recently led some small projects. I'm wondering if I should pursue a technical lead role or stay focused on deep technical work."
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",2,Coach,"What aspects of leading those small projects did you find most and least energizing?"
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",3,Developer,"I really enjoyed mentoring junior devs and architecting solutions, but I miss having long blocks of time to solve hard technical problems. When I'm in a flow state coding, I feel really fulfilled. But I also get a lot of satisfaction seeing people I've mentored succeed."
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",4,Coach,"That's a common tension many experienced developers face. Can you tell me about a specific recent day or week that felt particularly fulfilling?"
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",5,Developer,"Last month, I spent three days helping redesign our authentication system. I got to do deep technical work, but I also paired with two junior devs to explain the security concepts. They later implemented some of the features independently. It felt like a perfect mix."
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",6,Coach,"It sounds like you're most energized when you can combine technical depth with mentorship. How much of your current role lets you create these kinds of opportunities?"
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",7,Developer,"Maybe 25% of my time? Most days I'm either heads-down coding or in management meetings. There's not much middle ground."
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",8,Coach,"Before we explore specific career paths, I'm curious about your definition of a technical lead role. What does it look like in your current company?"
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",9,Developer,"Here, tech leads spend about 70% of time in meetings and reviewing code, 30% coding. They're responsible for delivery but don't do formal performance management."
"Mid-career Developer Deep Dive",10,Coach,"Given what you've shared about enjoying that mix of technical work and mentorship, have you considered paths like principal engineer or architect? Unlike traditional tech lead roles, these positions often let you: 1. Lead through technical expertise rather than project management 2. Mentor through system design and code reviews 3. Maintain significant hands-on coding time 4. Shape technical decisions at a higher level"
"Bootcamp Graduate Job Search",1,Developer,"I finished a web development bootcamp 3 months ago. I've built some React projects but keep getting rejected for not having a CS degree. Starting to feel discouraged."
"Bootcamp Graduate Job Search",2,Coach,"Before we discuss the degree question - tell me about the projects you've built and how you're currently approaching your job search."
"Bootcamp Graduate Job Search",3,Developer,"I built a task management app with React/Node and an e-commerce site. I've been applying to junior dev roles online but rarely hear back."
"Bootcamp Graduate Job Search",4,Coach,"Those are solid projects. But applying online is a tough route for bootcamp grads. Have you connected with any bootcamp alumni on LinkedIn? Many companies have engineers from non-traditional backgrounds who can give you relevant advice and potentially referrals."
"Senior Engineer Career Transition",1,Developer,"I've been at FAANG for 5 years, making good money, but feeling unchallenged. Same tech stack, same types of problems. Not sure what's next."
"Senior Engineer Career Transition",2,Coach,"When you say unchallenged - what kind of problems do you wish you were solving instead?"
"Senior Engineer Career Transition",3,Developer,"I'd love to work on harder technical problems, maybe something with ML/AI. But switching specialties feels risky at my level. I've built some side projects with PyTorch, but that's very different from production ML systems."
"Senior Engineer Career Transition",4,Coach,"What draws you to ML/AI specifically? Is it the technology itself or the types of problems it solves?"
"Senior Engineer Career Transition",5,Developer,"Both, really. I'm fascinated by the math behind it, but I'm also excited about the potential applications. I've been reading papers about ML in healthcare and it seems like an area where you could make real impact."
"Early Career Identity Crisis",1,Developer,"I'm 2 years into my career doing full stack work at a startup. Recently I'm questioning if I actually enjoy programming or if I just chose it for job security."
"Early Career Identity Crisis",2,Coach,"Let's explore that. When was the last time you felt truly excited about your work? Tell me about that experience."
"Early Career Identity Crisis",3,Developer,"Last month I built this API that helped our customer service team automate some tedious tasks. Seeing how much it helped them felt really good."
"Early Career Identity Crisis",4,Coach,"Interesting - you lit up when talking about the impact rather than the technical details. Some developers are primarily motivated by solving business problems rather than coding for its own sake. That's equally valid and might help guide which roles to pursue."
"Remote Work Transition",1,Developer,"I've got 8 years of backend experience but my company wants everyone back in office. I'd like to find a fully remote role but worried about taking a pay cut."
"Remote Work Transition",2,Coach,"The remote landscape has evolved significantly. What research have you done so far on companies offering remote roles at your level?"
"Remote Work Transition",3,Developer,"Honestly not much. I've mostly been looking at the big tech companies I know of."
"Remote Work Transition",4,Coach,"Consider exploring established remote-first companies like GitLab or Zapier. They often match Bay Area salaries and have really thoughtful remote cultures. Your backend skills are in high demand - you may have more leverage than you think."
